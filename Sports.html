                Football is an important part of my life, in fact it was the very first sport I ever practiced, 
                and my favorite for many many years. I started practicing it when i was 3 years old. 
                (Fun fact: my first number was 3, because of my age.) And I continued for many many years.

                My football carrer lasted about 13-14 years. My last football match was late november, 2022. 
                I had a fun football career, most of it I played defense. My last season (which i consider my best and
                most fun) I played Linebacker, which was one of the best decisions in football I ever made.
                I had an Incredible season, accumulating 3 turnovers in my favor (1 int, 1 scoop and score, 1 fumble),1 sack,
                1 TD, 1 rec and multiple solo tackles.

                    Though football ain't my main sport no more, It is still part of my life with flag football. In which I won
                    recently a championship of my school. And for my main sport I am doing martial arts and some weight lifting.
                    I want to make my body functional and to learn how to fight.
