                In this photo is only left my aunt (my father's sister) to really say that closest family is in this picture.
                They are my motivation and the main reason I want to really succeed.

                They are my best friends, they are also a great part of my life and some of my drive to succeed. I'm always trying
                to be sorrounded by people better than me in multiple areas, and I think trying to be better is also a way to give what I'm 
                asking for.

                    Also, I'm giving me the chance to know a new person on the romantic side, her name is Irais and at the time I could say
                    the relationship It's been great! I'm excited to what is coming for us.
